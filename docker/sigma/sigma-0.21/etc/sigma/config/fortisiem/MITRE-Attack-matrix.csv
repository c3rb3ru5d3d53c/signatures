T1498.002,Network Denial of Service: Reflection Amplification,Impact,"Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target. Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack.

T1557.002,Man-in-the-Middle: ARP Cache Poisoning,"Collection,Credential Access","Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation. An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment. Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) network traffic.

T1564.007,Hide Artifacts: VBA Stomping,Defense Evasion,"Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data. MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams. Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code. The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the VBA_PROJECT stream matches the version of the host MS Office application. An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero's, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code. Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code. If there is a version match between the VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007,No
T1565.001,Data Manipulation: Stored Data Manipulation,Impact,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.

T1566.001,Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment,Initial Access,"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001,No
T1566.002,Phishing: Spearphishing Link,Initial Access,"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.","Google Workspace,Linux,Office 365,SaaS,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002,Yes
T1566.003,Phishing: Spearphishing via Service,Initial Access,"Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels. Adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services. These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.  After building rapport with a target via social media, adversaries send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003,No
T1567.001,Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Code Repository,Exfiltration,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. Code repositories are often accessible via an API. Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection. Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001,No
T1567.002,Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage,Exfiltration,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.

T1568.001,Dynamic Resolution: Fast Flux DNS,Command And Control,"Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution. This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/001,No
T1568.002,Dynamic Resolution: Domain Generation Algorithms,Command And Control,"Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions. Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of Fallback Channels. When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002,No
T1568.003,Dynamic Resolution: DNS Calculation,Command And Control,"Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address. A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003,No
T1569.001,System Services: Launchctl,Execution,"Adversaries may abuse launchctl to execute commands or programs. Launchctl controls the macOS launchd process, which handles things like Launch Agent and Launch Daemon, but can execute other commands or programs itself. Launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input. Running a command from launchctl is simple and adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute code or even bypass application control if launchctl is an allowed process.",macOS,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001,No
T1569.002,System Services: Service Execution,Execution,Adversaries may abuse the Windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows service control manager is an interface to manage and manipulate services. The service control manager is accessible to users via GUI components as well as system utilities such as sc.exe. PsExec can also be used to execute commands or payloads via a temporary Windows service created through the service control manager API. Adversaries may execute malicious content by either executing a new or modified service. This technique is the execution used in conjunction with Windows Service during service persistence or privilege escalation.,Windows,https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002,No
T1570,Lateral Tool Transfer,Lateral Movement,Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Adversaries may copy files laterally between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares or with authenticated connections with SMB/Windows Admin Shares.,"Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570,No
T1571,Non-Standard Port,Command And Control,"Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port paring that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587, as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571,No
T1572,Protocol Tunneling,Command And Control,"Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet. Adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding),  DNS over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 communications and infrastructure.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572,No
T1573.001,Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography,Command And Control,"Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and RC4.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001,No
T1573.002,Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography,Command And Control,"Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm (also known as public key cryptography) to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver's public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data.","Linux,Windows,macOS",https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002,No
T1574.001,Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Defense Evasion,Persistence,Privilege Escalation","Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution. If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.
